## Oh wow even some more information

Isn't it great to get even more information about this?


This could involve some more data:

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar2
#| fig-cap: "Another line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
print(theta[:5])
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
plt.close()

```
